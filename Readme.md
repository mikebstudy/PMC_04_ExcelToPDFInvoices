# 04.PDFMaker Project
- From Python Mega Course (by Ardit Sulce)
- Portfolio like showcase project
- Day 25-26 - Project 4 - Build an Excel to PDF Invoice Generator 

- Three separate implementations 
  - course_C is from working the lessons
  - mikeb_M is enhanced implementation based on my own ideas and those of others on the internet
  - Claude_A is experiments in generating code similiar to course.C and mikeb.M
  - (C,M,A - are the letters that proceed git commit comments and correspond to the respective implementations)

- Github repo: https://github.com/mikebstudy/PMC_04_ExcelToPDFInvoices
  - each implementation is in its own folder 

## course_C
- Minor changes to code that reflects a slightly different organization of the code
- Tweaks in the output, but basically the same as the course produced

## mikeb_M
- Starting with the final course_C version.

## Claude_A
